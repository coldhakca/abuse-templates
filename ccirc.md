Greetings,

The IP that relates to this notification is a Tor Exit Node [1]. Tor is software that enables access to information, and furthers privacy and security on the Internet. For more information please see the project website [2].

Browsing to that IP address with a web browser or performing a reverse lookup in DNS further communicates this fact.

We would suggest that in the future automated tools are used to filter out communications relating to Tor Exit Nodes. A complete list of exit nodes is publicly available [3].

All the best,
Coldhak
